\ Infinite Loop Examples for Slate Language
\ 
\ WARNING: These loops will run forever! 
\ Use Ctrl+C to terminate when testing.

\ Example 1: Single-line infinite loop
loop print("Hello from single-line loop!")

\ Example 2: Multi-line loop without end marker
var count = 0
print("Starting counter without end marker...")

loop
    count = count + 1
    print("Count: " + count)

\ Example 3: Multi-line loop with optional end marker
var counter2 = 100
print("Starting counter with end marker...")

loop
    counter2 = counter2 - 1
    print("Countdown: " + counter2)
end loop

\ Note: All these loops will run forever! You need Ctrl+C to stop.
\ 
\ In a real scenario, you'd want break/continue statements:
\ 
\ Single-line with break:
\ loop if condition then break else print("continuing")
\
\ Multi-line with break:
\ loop
\     count = count + 1
\     print("Count: " + count)
\     if count > 10 then break
\ end loop
\
\ But break/continue are not implemented yet in this language.
